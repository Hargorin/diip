\chapter{Verification \& Benchmark} \label{chapt:ver_bench}
With the image processing an dataflow parts implemented, they can be verified
and benchmarked. The next chapters hold the verification process of both the
image processing part and the dataflow part. After both components are verified
they are benchmarked as one unity against a computer based implementation in
chapter \ref{ch:benchmark}.

\section{Verification} \label{ch:verification}
The verification process ensures that all components work as expected. It is
split into the image processing and dataflow parts. They are tested
independantly to reduce complexity and simulation time. The system as a unity is
then tested in chapter \ref{ch:verification:overallvalidation}.

\subsection{Image Procession}\label{ch:verification:imageprocessing}
The verification of the image processing is done using two different 
methods. First, an image is processed with the Wallis filter and compared 
with a reference image. The reference image is generated from a C/C++ program 
which calculates uses floating point percision for calculations. In the second
aspect the 
throughput is validated. \\
The devices under validation (DUV) consist of two written in Vivado HLS using
C/C++
and one VHDL version. The Vivado HLS versions differ in the input stream. One 
has an 8 bit AXI4-Stream and the other one has a 256 bit AXI4-Stream input. The
VHDL has an 8 bit AXI4-Stream.

\subsubsection*{Image Comparsion}
During the verification an image is processed with the Wallis filter. The Wallis
filter is run on the computer as a C/C++ program and has floating point
variables. This Wallis filtering is used as a reference. Two images (room and
mountain), added in appendix \ref{app:images_wallis}, are chosen as reference images. \\
The reference images are passed through the DUV and compared with the reference
images. The \gls{rmse} serves as a metric. The RMSE
indicates how much the  Wallis filtered image deviates on average from the
reference image \cite{rmse}. The parameters for the Wallis filter that were used
for the images can be found in table \ref{tab:parameter}.

\begin{table}[tb!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l l l l l}
        \toprule
        Image & Brightness & Contrast & Global Mean & Global Variance \\
        \midrule
        room \ref{fig:ref_room} & 0.5 & 0.8125 & 127 & 3600 \\
        mountain \ref{fig:ref_mountain} & 0.5 & 0.8125 & 127 & 3600 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Parameters for the Wallis filter}
    \label{tab:parameter}
\end{table}



Table \ref{tab:rmse_room} lists the RMSE values of the room image and table 
\ref{tab:rmse_mountain} the RMSE
values of the mountain image. They
represent the deviation from the reference image in percent. The deviation from
the C/C++ program with the 8 bit AXI4 stream and the 256 bit AXI4 stream do
not differ from each other. A total deviation of 0.32\% has been measured for
the
room image. This corresponds to an intensity value of 0.816 in the range of 0 -
255. There is also only a deviation of 0.33\% in the mountain image. The VHDL
verification is with 1.23\% respectively 0.49\% higher than the
HLS versions. The intensity deviates by 3.14 pixels or 1.25 pixels respectively.
It is assumed that the deviation occurs due to rounding in the VHDL solution. In
comparison to the HLS solution, the VHDL solution does not calculate the mean
and the variance exactly. Further it is assumed that image contents play a
role. Meaning how strong the intensity in the image differs in regard to the
location. The room image changes intensity more often, whereby the mountain
image is bright at the top and dark at the bottom.

    \caption{RMSE of the Wallis filter verification using the mountain image}
    \label{tab:rmse_mountain}
\end{table}

\subsubsection*{Throughput}
During verification, the throughput of the Wallis filter is also evaluated.
For this purpose, the throughput at the input of the filter is measured. This
means how many pixels per clock are loaded into the Wallis filter. Again, the
three different methods (HLS 8bit, HLS 256bit \& VHDL 8bit) of the Wallis filter
are compared. Table \ref{tab:throughput} lists the three different methods. The
8 bit versions should have a throughput of one pixel per clock, this is 125Mp/s
at 125MHz clock frequency. But the HLS 8 bit version only reaches 21 pixels in
86 clocks. This results in a throughput of 30.5Mp/s. This is four times slower
than the theoretical value. This has to do with the fact that the division
requires 23 clock cycles and that the loop cannot be pipelined by reading the
pixels (see chapter \ref{ch:hls:div} and \ref{ch:ip:axi}). For this reason the
256 bit version was developed. It has a theoretical maximum of 2625Mp/s
throughput. A throughput of 21 pixels in 11 clock cycles could be achieved. This
is equivalent to 238.6Mp/s. in relation to the 8 bit version only a better
throughput of a factor of 7.8 could be achieved. The limiting factor is still
the division. With the VHDL version the theoretical maximum of 125Mp/s has been
reached.

\begin{table}[tb!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l l l l}
        \toprule
        DUV & Target [p/clk] & Actual [p/clk]  & Throughput [Mp/s]\\
        \midrule
        HLS 8bit    & 1     & 21/86     & 30.5\\
        HLS 256bit  & 21    & 21/11     & 238.6 \\
        VHDL        & 1     & 1         & 125 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Throughput of the Wallis filter related to the input pixels at
    125MHz clock frequency}
    \label{tab:throughput}
\end{table}


\subsubsection*{Ressource} \label{ch:ver:ip:ressource}
For the implementation of the Wallis filter, another important factor is the
resources it requires on the FPGA. The resources used in the FPGA for the
implementation of the Wallis filter are listed in table \ref{tab:ressource} as
absolute values and as percentage of the available in the FPGA (value in
parantheses).
Slices, Block RAMs and DSPs are compared with each other. A slice in the FPGA 
(XC7A200T) contains four LUTs and eight flip-flops \cite{ds180}.
The VHDL implementation needs the least resources in the comparison. All
three implementations need practically the same number of DSPs. Comparing
the two HLS versions, the 256bit version needs less block memory, but more
slices.

%
% ==============================================================================
\subsection{Dataflow}\label{ch:verification:dataflow}
The dataflow part is again divided into two parts, the communication and
controller parts. While in the communication part only the most recent version
is tested (reffering to chapter \ref{chapt:dataflow} explaining the solotion
A and B with streaming interface), both versions of the controller are verified.

\subsubsection*{Communication}
The communication part was in a large part taken from the last semester project
and was been thoroughly tested and validated in the project report 
\cite{p5report}. The three new implemented features are verified in this
chapter. They consist of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Acknowledge
    \item User registers
    \item Stream interface
\end{itemize}

\vspace{1ex}
\textbf{Acknowledge:} To test the acknowledge function, a file was sent to the
FPGA from the computer
and the Ethernet traffic monitored with Wireshark Netowrk Protocol Analyzer.
Wiresharks packet dissections are exported to a json file that was then analyzed
using the \texttt{uftcheck} utility. It was written to analyze network pacekts
for UFT transfers. The first lines of output yielded:

\end{minipage}
% \end{adjustbox}

\vspace{1ex}
The sending PC starts a file transmission with a file transfer start packet and
the first data packet. The next packet (3) is comming from the FPGA to the PC
and acknowledges the first data packet (sequence 0). To verify that all packets
are acknowledged, the sending program reports an acknowledge status after the
files has been sent.

\end{minipage}

\vspace{1ex}
\textbf{User register:} To test wether the user registers can be written and are
output correctly by the communication core, a \gls{ila} 
was used. An ILA can be configured on the FPGA to record internal signals. The
results are transferred to the PC over USB and displayed in \gls{vivadohlx}. All
user registers (0 through 7) are written with differen values and the reult
observed using the ILA matched the sent data.

\vspace{1ex}
\textbf{Stream interface:} The last modification made to the communication core
was the AXI4-Stream interface. This was similarly tested as the user registers.
Using an ILA the output of the stream was observed and the correct order of data
verified. 

\subsubsection*{Controller} 
The most important thing to verify in the controller core is the correct order
of output pixel. This is done by generating input data representing an image,
feeding this data through the controller core and observing the output pixels.
This validation is split into the two solutions implemented using HLS (solution
A) and VHDL (solution B).

\vspace{1ex}
\textbf{Solution A) HLS:} In Vivado HLS the validation was done in C and
Co-simulation. A testbench C/C++ file generates pseudo random image data. This
data is then processed using the controller core and in the testbench itself.
The two results are then compared. Using different input data and image sizes,
all output results matched. A test on the FPGA was omitted. This validation will
later take plave in the overall validation in chapter \ref{ch:verification:overallvalidation}.

\vspace{1ex}
\textbf{Solution B) VHDL:} The same approach was used in the solution written in
VHDL except that the testbench is not written in C/C++ but in VHDL. The input
stream sends an incrementing pixel value with an image width and height of
eight. The window length was reduced to three for simplicity. Figure 
\ref{fig:vhdlcontrollerstimuli} shows the input data values.

 \begin{figure}[h!]

    \caption{VHDL controller validation stimuli}

\end{figure}

Observed was the output stream that was stored in a text file by the VHDL
testbench. The resulting pixel order was then validated using random samples.
Listing \ref{lst:controlleroutstreamvhdl} shows the output pixel values of the
first three lines.

%                             Overall Validation
%
% ==============================================================================
\subsection{Overall Validation}\label{ch:verification:overallvalidation}
To validate the overall system, the image processing and dataflow parts are
combined in a Vivado HLx project. Two projects are distinguished:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \texttt{diip}\footnote{\Gls{diip}} Project using solution A) with HLS
    implementation
    \item \texttt{diip\_faster} Project using solution B) with VHDL
    implementation
\end{itemize}

On the computer side, the program \texttt{diip\_cc} written in C++ reads the
pixels from an input image, splits the data into according UFT packets and sends
them to the FPGA. The processed pixels are received and stored in the output
image. Similar to the proceeding in \ref{ch:verification:imageprocessing} two
test images were used and compared to the results of a floating point
calculation on the computer. The resulting \gls{rmse} is listed in table 
\ref{tab:overallvalidationresults}. The verification of the entire system on
the FPGA is positive. It can be seen that the HLS solution has the same
deviation as the simulation on the PC (see chapter 
\ref{ch:verification:imageprocessing}). The VHDL version has a smaller
deviation across the entire system than the \gls{ghdl} simulation on the PC (see
chapter \ref{ch:verification:imageprocessing}). Also to be seen here is that
the room image has a larger deviation in the VHDL solution than the
mountain image. This is to be justified with the same reasons as explained in
chapter \ref{ch:verification:imageprocessing}. It is assumed that this depends on the rounding and the image content. 


\begin{table}[tb!] \centering \begin{tabular}{l c c}

\section{Benchmark}\label{ch:benchmark}
To conclude the results of this work, the different solutions are compared in
this chapter. The working implementations (including send and receive from PC)
and theoretical limits are differentiated. Furthermore the throughput is
compared to a CPU based solution.
There are four different processing methods in total.

\begin{itemize}
    \item The solution using HLS with 8bit data bus
    \item The solution using HLS with 256bit data bus. This method was not
    implemented on the FPGA hence simulation results were used
    \item The solution implemented using VHDL
    \item A programm running on CPU written in C++
\end{itemize}

Methods 1. and 3. are measured by processing an image stored on the computer
which is sent to the FPGA, processed and sent back. The time required for the
processing of an image divided by its pixel count result in the throughput
measured in megapixels per second ($Mp/s$). To calculate the throughput of
method 2. the results from \ref{ch:verification:imageprocessing} is used. Method
4. is written in C++ and uses OpenCV to read image data. Throughput is
calculated the same as for methods 1. and 3.
\\

As source image a fixed aspect ration of 16:9 was chosen. This is a common
format used among other for movies. The image was resized to four different
heights: 480p, 720p, 1080p and 2160p with the largest one being equivalent to
the
4k image standard. The content of the image does not influence the throughput.

\subsection{Compare implementations}
First the two working FPGA implementations are put to contrast (1. and 3.).
Figure \ref{fig:benchmarkcompare} and table \ref{tab:throughputmeasuremetns}
show the results of the throughput measurements. The missing value for HLS 8bit
is due to a bug in the computer software for this image size that could not be
resolved by the time the benchmark was made. The HLS 8bit implementation yields
the lowest throughput. This is mainly due to the controller core which requires
the image data to be re-sent for every line the wallis filter processes. No
image lines are buffered on the FPGA. The VHDL implementation yields the
highest
throughput. This was to be expected for two
reasons. First, the VHDL wallis filter core can process pixels at one pixel per
clock cycle which is more than the 8bit HLS version is capeable of (21 pixels
per 86 clock cycles).
Second, the memory management was been greatly improved from the HLS to the VHDL
controller in that image data is buffered on the FPGA to reduce multiple
transmissions of image data from PC to FPGA.

\begin{table}[tb!]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l l l l l l}
        \toprule
        Solution & 480p & 720p & 1080p & 2160p & \\
        \midrule
        HLS 8bit   & 0.17  &       & 0.168 & 0.161 & $MB/s$ \\
        % HLS 256bit & 11.3 & 11.1 & 11.0 & 10.9 \\
        VHDL       & 0.89  & 1.291 & 2.348 & 4.115 & $MB/s$\\
        % CPU        & 12.56 & 16.23 & 15.99 & 15.91 \\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Throughput measurements}
    \label{tab:throughputmeasuremetns}
\end{table}

The increase in throughput over image size on the VHDL solution can be explained
by the way the
PC program works. To prevent an overflow of the image cache inside the
controller on the FPGA, a delay of $d_l$ seconds is inserted after an image line
is sent. This ensures that the FPGA is given enough time to calculate one image
line. From there the theoretical maximum throughput can be calculated. Equation
\ref{eq:theomaxb} shows the throughput (for derivation refer to appendix 
\ref{app:derivations:theomax}). $d_l$ was set to $500\mu s$ for the benchmark.

\begin{align}
    b  & \approx \frac{i_w}{d_l + \frac{i_w}{b_e}}
    \label{eq:theomaxb}
\end{align}

\begin{tabular}{rl}
    $b     =$ & theoretical throughput of VHDL solution \\
    $i_w   =$ & image width \\
    $d_l   =$ & delay between sending two image lines \\
    $b_e   =$ & ethernet throughput \\
\end{tabular} \\

If $d_l$ were to be reduced to zero, the throughput would strive towards $b_e$.

\subsection{Compare theoretical limits}
To show the real performance of a FPGA for image processing the theoretical
limits are put to contrast in this chapter without considering how the image
data is sent to the FPGA.
Before this can be done the maximum possible throughput of the three FPGA
implementations are calculated.

\begin{align}
    b_{ip}  & = \frac{i_hb_w}{w_l (i_h-w_l+1)}
    \label{eq:theomaxvhdlwallisshort}
\end{align}

\begin{tabular}{rl}
    $b_{ip}=$ & theoretical throughput image processing core \\
    $i_h   =$ & image height \\
    $b_w   =$ & throughput of image processing core on input in pixels per
    second \\
    $w_l   =$ & window length \\
\end{tabular} \\

Equation \ref{eq:theomaxvhdlwallisshort} is used to calculate the maximum
possible throughput for each of the test images (for derivation refer to
appendix \ref{app:derivations:theomaxvhdlwallis}). Figure \ref{fig:theoresults}
and table \ref{tab:FPGAimplementationstheoreticallimits} show the theoretical
maximum results.

        HLS 8bit       & 29.1 & 1.45 & 1.43 & 1.41 & 1.40 & $MB/s$\\
        HLS 256bit     & 228  & 11.3 & 11.1 & 11.0 & 10.9 & $MB/s$\\
        VHDL           & 119  & 5.92 & 5.84 & 5.78 & 5.73 & $MB/s$\\
        \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{FPGA implementations theoretical limits}
    \label{tab:FPGAimplementationstheoreticallimits}
\end{table}

The HLS 8bit solution is the slowest of the three implementations. Its filter
core accepts 21 pixels per 86 clock cycles as described in table \ref{tab:throughput}. 
With the input width of the IP-core extended to 265bit,
a new throughput of around 11 MB/s is achieved. The third solution written
in VHDL is placed in between the two HLS solutions. Its IP-core accepts one
pixel per clock cycle. This yields a throughput of approximately 5.8MB/s at
125MHz clock frequency.

\subsection{FPGA versus CPU}
Now that the different implementations are compared against each other, the
two implementations with the highest throughput (VHDL and HLS 256bit
implementations) are put to contrast with a CPU based computation.  The CPU
programm was run multiple times for each image and the mean throughput is
calculated. The program was running on a Intel Core i7-6700HQ running at 2.60
GHz on a single core.  Figure \ref{fig:theoreticalmax} and table
\ref{tab:throughputcompare} show the results.
\\

The CPU performance is the fastest of all three. It processes the images 2.76
times faster than the VHDL solution and 1.45 times faster than the HLS 256bit
solution. As mentioned in the scalability chapter (\ref{chapt:scalability}) the
throughput of both FPGA implementations (VHDL and HLS 256bit) can be improved by
implementing the Wallis filter multiple times on one FPGA. By implementing the
HLS solution twice or the VHDL solution three times, a regular CPU could already
be outrunned by one FPGA.

\subsection{Throughput vs. Area Efficiency}
Finally, the throughput efficiency of the Wallis filter is examined. The three
Wallis filter implementation are compared. The efficiency of the
implementations is examined depending on the area they are using on the FPGA
and their theoretical throughput. The area is shown in table 
\ref{tab:ressource}. Only one resource is considered for meaningful efficiency.
The DSP is omitted for comparison, since all three implementations consume the
same amount. The BlockRAM is also not selected, because the controller needs
much more BlockRAM than the Wallis filter and it needs less than slice in percentage. For this reason, the slice is compared for throughput efficiency. The efficiency is in kB/s per slice. The VHDL code has the best efficiency by far. The efficiency of the VHDL to the HLS version differs by a factor of 1000, whereby the two HLS versions differ only by a factor of 5.
