\chapter{Mission} \label{chapt:mission}
The following sections will
first cover the starting point based on appendix \ref{app:aufgabenstellung} and the available resources (appendix \ref{app:technicial_requirements}). Different possible
solutions will be covered in \ref{chapt:solutions} before presenting the concept
in \ref{chapt:mission:concept}.

In a world of self driving cars and virtual reality, having a digital copy of
the real world yields several benefits. Cars can be trained in a virtual city
to increase the performance of their algorithms and video games could get more
realistic if the player could walk through the streets of a major city. Gathering
this data is one problem and processing the images is another. Pictures have
to be converted, analyzed and processed. This requires a great deal of
computational power for a task that is repeated several times.
